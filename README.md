# Image-Intensity-Graphing
first pass at comparing the intensities of two images along a line

Code adapted from Image Analyst's response, which can be found in the following link:
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/112348-how-to-get-intensity-along-a-spcific-curve

NOTE: the lengths/positions of the lines measuring intensity can be changed, but they should both be approximately the same length for best graph results
Currently, this code accepts and measures two images, but that could easily be adjusted to accommodate more/fewer images.
